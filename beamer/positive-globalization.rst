The positive effects of globalization.
======================================



What is globalization actually up to?

Let us shed light on it all through this presentation.

The term Globalization describes the process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views, products, ideas and other aspects of culture. Advances in transportation and telecommunication infrastructure, including the rise of the telegraph and its posterity, the internet, are major factors in globalization, generating further interdependency of economic and cultural activities.

What do you think? Is globlalization good or bad? Development or degradation?




Despite  its challenges, the positive role globalization has played in changing the lives of millions of people around the world is commendable. 

The advantages of globalization are all-pervasive and a lot of developing countries are benefiting from it.   



Increased competition
---------------------


Domestic companies have to fight out foreign competition. They are compelled to rise their standards and customer satisfaction levels in order to survive in the market. And when an new brand enters a country, it has to live up to many expectations the local customers have. This results in an improved quality of products and customer services.

Employment
----------

With globalization, companies have entered developing countries and hence generated employement for them.

Globalization has given the opportunity to invest in the emerging markets and tap the talets which are available there.

In developing there is often a lack of capital which hinders the growth of domestic companies and hence, employment. In such cases, due to the global nature of the business, people of developing countries too can obtain employment opportunities.
